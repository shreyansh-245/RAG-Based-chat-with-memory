      "Bot: If your car is stolen, damaged as a result of theft, or damaged by fire, lightning, or an explosion, your insurance may cover the costs. The cover for theft typically includes repairing the damage, replacing stolen items, or settling the claim with a payment. However, specific details may vary based on the type of insurance you have, such as TPFT Essential Comp or Comp+. It's best to refer to your car insurance policy details for precise information on what is covered in case of theft.\n",
